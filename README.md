# URL Shortener

## A quick project to show off how fast you can spin-off a live web-service with Django.

#### The simple application can be found at: [https://djshorty.herokuapp.com/](https://djshorty.herokuapp.com/)

If you are on Linux and want to run it from source - make sure to have "xclip" locally installed (`sudo apt install xclip`)

(The entire project was built and hosted in under 90 minutes. No security measures (such as hiding your SECRET_KEY, DB_USER etc) have been taken into account before deployment)
